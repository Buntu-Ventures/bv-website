            <h2>PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY</h2>

            <p> This Privacy Policy applies to Buntu Ventures Ltd., our partnering websites and which are owned and operated by Buntu Ventures Ltd. (the &ldquo;Site(s)&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy describes how Buntu Ventures Ltd. (&ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide in relation to the Sites only and does not represent all privacy practices conducted by us in our other businesses. It describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. The use of information collected through the Sites shall be limited to the purposes of: (i) providing the service for which a client of Buntu Ventures Ltd. (&ldquo;Client&rdquo;) has engaged Buntu Ventures Ltd.; (ii) providing a service to you and other Users of the Sites (&ldquo;Users&rdquo;); and/or (iii) the purpose for which you signed up to receive communications from us. If you do not want your personal information to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use these Sites.</p>

            <p>Buntu Ventures Ltd. (including the Sites as listed above) complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.

            <p>  We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:</p>

            <p>To better understand how Users access and use our Sites, both on an aggregated and individual User basis, on individual Sites and across them in order to improve our Sites and respond to User desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes;</p>

            <p>For marketing, and promotional purposes, including, for example, to send you news and newsletters, promotions, or to otherwise contact you about projects, opportunities or information we think may interest you provided you have opted into receiving such communications from us; to administer surveys and questionnaires; and</p>

            <p>To protect our own rights and interests, such as to resolve any disputes, enforce our Terms of Use, and to respond to legal requests.</p>

            <p>In the interests of educational research around Buntu Ventures Ltd. values and teachings such as human-centered approaches and design thinking. Buntu Ventures Ltd. has affiliations with many educational establishments including but not limited to Harvard and Stanford University for this purpose.</p>

            <p>To allow you to access and register for our services more easily (e.g in the setting up of personal profile accounts through third-party businesses you are already signed up to, such as Facebook or Google).</p>

            <p>We only collect the minimum amount of Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving the aforementioned purposes.</p>

            <p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other Users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.</p>

            <p>If you submit any Personal Information to us in response to a job posting (e.g. your resume), this may be shared with third parties (including external tools and services we use to manage our talent pool), depending on the nature of your inquiry. Personal Information collected in this capacity will be used solely for the purpose specified; such information is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your country and gender). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Users of the Sites to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Sites, and to analyze and understand how the Sites are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product or service to you according to your preferences or restrictions, or to send you User surveys or requests for feedback. We may collect any Personal Information you provide through such surveys or calls for feedback.</p>
